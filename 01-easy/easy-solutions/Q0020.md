Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        mapping = {"(": ")", "[": "]",  "{": "}"}
        stack = []

        for char in s:
            if char in '({[':
                stack.append(char)
            elif stack and char == mapping[stack[-1]]:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                return False

        return len(stack) == 0
```
