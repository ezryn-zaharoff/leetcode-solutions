## Q0069: [Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

â€¢ For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        left_boundary, right_boundary = 0, x
      
        while left_boundary < right_boundary:
            mid = (left_boundary + right_boundary + 1) >> 1
          
            if mid <= x // mid:
                left_boundary = mid
            else:
                right_boundary = mid - 1
      
        return left_boundary
```

```
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        return math.floor(abs(math.sqrt(x)))
```
