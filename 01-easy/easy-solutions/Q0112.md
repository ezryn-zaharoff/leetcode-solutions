## Q0112: [Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such
that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        curr = 0

        def check(curr, root):
            if not root: return False

            curr += root.val
            if curr == targetSum and not root.left and not root.right: return True

            return check(curr, root.left) or check(curr, root.right)
        
        return check(0, root)
