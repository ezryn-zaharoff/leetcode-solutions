## Q0202: [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

• Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
• Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does
  not include 1.
• Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        while n > 4:
            curr = 0
            while n:
                n, v = divmod(n, 10)
                curr += v * v
            n = curr

        return n == 1
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        while (n > 4) {
            int curr = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                curr += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = curr;
        }

        return n == 1;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var isHappy = function(n) {
    while (n > 4) {
        var curr = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            curr += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
            n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        }
        n = curr;
    }

    return n == 1;
};
