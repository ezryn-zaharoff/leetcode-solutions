## Q0222: [Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and
all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last
level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var countNodes = function(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
};
