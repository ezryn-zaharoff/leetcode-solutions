## Q0278: [First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest
version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to
find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if isBadVersion(mid): right = mid
            else: left = mid + 1

        return left
```

#### Java:

```
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var solution = function(isBadVersion) {
    return function(n) {
        let left = 1, right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    };
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
};
```

#### Scala:

```
class Solution extends VersionControl {
    def firstBadVersion(n: Int): Int = {
        var left = 1
        var right = n

        while (left < right) {
            var mid = left + (right - left) / 2
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) right = mid
            else left = mid + 1
        }

        left
    }
}
```

#### Go:

```
func firstBadVersion(n int) int {
    left, right := 1, n

    for (left < right) {
        mid := left + (right - left) / 2
        if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
            right = mid
        } else {
            left = mid + 1
        }
    }

    return left
}
