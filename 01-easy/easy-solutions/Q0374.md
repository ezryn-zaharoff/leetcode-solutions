## Q0374: Guess Number Higher or Lower

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

• -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
• 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
• 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if guess(mid) == 0: return mid
            elif guess(mid) == -1: right = mid
            elif guess(mid) == 1: left = mid + 1

        return left
```
