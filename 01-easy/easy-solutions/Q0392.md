## Q0392: [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a
subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if s == "": return True
        elif t == "": return False

        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        i, count = 0, 0

        for j in range(n):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                count += 1
                i += 1

            if count == m:
                return True

        return False
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) i++;
            j++;
        }

        return i == s.length();
    }
}
