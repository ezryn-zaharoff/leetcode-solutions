## Q0441: [Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the
ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            total = (mid * (mid + 1)) // 2

            if total == n:
                return mid
            elif total < n:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return right
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int left = 0, right = n;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            int total = (mid * (mid + 1)) / 2;

            if (total == n) return mid;
            else if (total < n) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }

        return right;
    }
}
