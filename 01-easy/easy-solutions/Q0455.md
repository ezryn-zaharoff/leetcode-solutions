## Q0455: [Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child
at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with;
and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i
will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort(), s.sort()
        i, count = 0, 0

        for n in s:
            if g[i] <= n:
                i += 1
                count += 1

            if count == len(g): break

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g); Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0, count = 0;

        for (int n : s) {
            if (g[i] <= n) {
                i++; count++;
            }
                
            if (count == g.length) break;
        }
            
        return count;
    }
}
