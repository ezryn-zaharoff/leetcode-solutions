## Q0463: [Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0
represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water,
and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One
cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the
perimeter of the island.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        perimeter = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    perimeter += 4

                    if i + 1 < m and grid[i+1][j] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2
                    if j + 1 < n and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2

        return perimeter
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;

                    if (i + 1 < m && grid[i+1][j] == 1)
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    if (j + 1 < n && grid[i][j+1] == 1)
                        perimeter -= 2;
                }
            }
        }

        return perimeter;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var islandPerimeter = function(grid) {
    let m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    let perimeter = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                perimeter += 4;

                if (i + 1 < m && grid[i+1][j] == 1)
                    perimeter -= 2;
                if (j + 1 < n && grid[i][j+1] == 1)
                    perimeter -= 2;
            }
        }
    }

    return perimeter;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        int perimeter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;

                    if (i + 1 < m && grid[i+1][j] == 1)
                        perimeter -= 2;
                    if (j + 1 < n && grid[i][j+1] == 1)
                        perimeter -= 2;
                }
            }
        }

        return perimeter;
    }
};
