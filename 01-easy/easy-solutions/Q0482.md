## Q0482: [License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group,
which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash
inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        s = s.replace("-",'').upper()
        grp = len(s) % k

        ans = []

        if grp > 0:
            ans.append(s[:grp])

        for i in range(grp, len(s), k):
            ans.append(s[i:i+k])

        return '-'.join(ans)
