        for word in words:
            for i, ch in enumerate(word):
                if len(word) == 1:
                    ans.append(word)
                elif i == 0:

                        if ch.lower() in keyboard[j]:

                            continue
                else:
                    if ch.lower() in keyboard[row]:
                        if i == len(word) - 1:
                            ans.append(word)
