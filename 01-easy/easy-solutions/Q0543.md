## Q0543: [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or
may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        ans = 0

        def height(node):
            nonlocal ans
            if not node: return 0

            leftHeight = height(node.left)
            rightHeight = height(node.right)
            ans = max(ans, leftHeight + rightHeight)

            return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1

        height(root)
        return ans
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    private int ans = 0;

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        height(root);
        return ans;
    }

    public int height(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int leftHeight = height(node.left);
        int rightHeight = height(node.right);
        ans = Math.max(ans, leftHeight + rightHeight);

        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
