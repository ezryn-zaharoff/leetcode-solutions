```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

• 'A': Absent.
• 'L': Late.
• 'P': Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

• The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
• The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.

    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        ab = 0

        for i,ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch == 'A':
                ab += 1
                if ab == 2:
                    return False
                    break
            elif ch == 'L':
                if i > 1 and s[i-1] == 'L' and s[i-2] == 'L':
                    return False
