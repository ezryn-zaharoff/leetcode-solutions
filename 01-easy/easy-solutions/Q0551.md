## Q0551: Student Attendance Record I

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

• 'A': Absent.
• 'L': Late.
• 'P': Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

• The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
• The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        ab, late = 0, 0

        for ch in s:
            if ch == 'A':
                ab += 1
                if ab == 2: return False
                late = 0
            elif ch == 'L':
                late += 1
                if late == 3: return False
            else:
                late = 0

        return True
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean checkRecord(String s) {
        int ab = 0, late = 0;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'A') {
                ab++;
                if (ab == 2) return false;
                late = 0;
            } else if (ch == 'L') {
                late++;
                if (late == 3) return false;
            } else {
                late = 0;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
