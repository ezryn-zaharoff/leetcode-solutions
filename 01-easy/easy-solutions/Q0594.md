## Q0594: [Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and
its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious 
subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_count = Counter(nums)
        counts = num_count.keys()
        max_count = 0

        for count in counts:
            if count + 1 in counts:
                max_count = max(max_count, num_count[count] + num_count[count+1])

        return max_count
