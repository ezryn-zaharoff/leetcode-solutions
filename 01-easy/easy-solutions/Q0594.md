## Q0594: Longest Harmonious Subsequence

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious 
subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findLHS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numbers = sorted(list(set(nums)))
        num_count = Counter(nums)
        max_count = 0

        for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
            if i == len(numbers) - 1:
                break
            elif numbers[i+1] - num == 1:
                max_count = max(max_count, num_count[num] + num_count[num+1])

        return max_count
