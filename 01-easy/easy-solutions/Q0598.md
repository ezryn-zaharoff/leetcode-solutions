## Q0598: Range Addition II

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maxCount(self, m: int, n: int, ops: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not ops:
            return m * n

        min_x = min(op[0] for op in ops)
        min_y = min(op[1] for op in ops)

        return min_x * min_y
```
