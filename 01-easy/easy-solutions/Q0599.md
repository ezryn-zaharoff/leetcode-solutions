## Q0599: [Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j]
then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        word_total, ans = [], []
        
        for i, word1 in enumerate(list1):
            for j, word2 in enumerate(list2):
                if word1 == word2:
                    total = i + j
                    word_total.append((word1, total))

        if len(word_total) == 1:
            ans.append(word_total[0][0])
        elif len(word_total) > 1:
            min_total = min(word[1] for word in word_total)
            for i in range(len(word_total)):
                if word_total[i][1] == min_total:
                    ans.append(word_total[i][0])

        return ans
