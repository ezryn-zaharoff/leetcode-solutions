## Q0599: [Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j]
then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n1, n2 = len(list1), len(list2)
        mp = {}

        for i, word in enumerate(list1): mp[word] = i

        min_sum = n1 + n2
        ans = []

        for i, word in enumerate(list2):
            if word in mp:
                if i + mp[word] < min_sum:
                    min_sum = i + mp[word]
                    ans = [word]                       
                elif i + mp[word] == min_sum:
                    ans.append(word)
                
        return ans
