## Q0674: Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count, ans = 1, 1

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 1

        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 1

            if count > ans:
                ans = count

        return ans
