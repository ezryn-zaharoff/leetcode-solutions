## Q0717: [1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

We have two special characters:

• The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
• The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        n, i = len(bits), 0

        while i < n:
            if i == n-1: return True
            if bits[i] == 1: i += 1
            i += 1

        return False
