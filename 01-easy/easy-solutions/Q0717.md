## Q0717: 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

We have two special characters:

â€¢ The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
â€¢ The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        ans = True
        
        for bit in bits[-2::-1]:
            if bit:
                ans = not ans
            else:
                break

        return ans
```
