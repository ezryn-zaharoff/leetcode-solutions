## Q0728: Self Dividing Numbers

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

â€¢ For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right] (both inclusive).
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def selfDividingNumbers(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        ans = []

        for num in range (left, right + 1):
            s = str(num)
            count = 0

            for i in s:
                i = int(i)
                if i == 0 or num % i != 0:
                    break
                elif i != 0 and num % i == 0:
                    count += 1

            if count == len(s):
                ans.append(num)

        return ans
```
