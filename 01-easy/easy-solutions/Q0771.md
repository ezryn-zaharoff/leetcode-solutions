## Q0771: Jewels and Stones

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing
the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many
of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0

        for ch in stones:
            if ch in jewels:
                count += 1

        return count
```
