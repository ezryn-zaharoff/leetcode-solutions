## Q0771: [Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing
the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many
of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        count = 0

        for ch in stones:
            if ch in jewels:
                count += 1

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length(); i++) {
            if (jewels.indexOf(stones.charAt(i)) != -1) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let ch of stones) {
        if (jewels.includes(ch)) count++;
    }

    return count;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int count = 0;

        for (char ch : stones) {
            if (jewels.find(ch) != string::npos) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Scala:

```
object Solution {
    def numJewelsInStones(jewels: String, stones: String): Int = {
        var count = 0

        for (ch <- stones) {
            if (jewels.contains(ch)) count += 1
        }

        count
    }
}
```

#### Go:

```
func numJewelsInStones(jewels string, stones string) int {
    count := 0

    for _, ch := range stones {
        if strings.Contains(jewels, string(ch)) {count++}
    }

    return count
}
