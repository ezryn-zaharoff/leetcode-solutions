## Q0796: [Rotate String](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

â€¢ For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        m, n = len(s), len(goal)
        if m != n: return False

        for i in range(n):
            if goal[i] == s[0]:
                sub = goal[i:] + goal[:i]
                if sub == s: return True

        return False
