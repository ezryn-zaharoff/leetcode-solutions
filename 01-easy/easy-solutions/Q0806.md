## Q0806: [Number of Lines To Write String](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-lines-to-write-string/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each
lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and
so on.

You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the
beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels.
Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue
this process until you have written all of s.

Return an array result of length 2 where:

• result[0] is the total number of lines.
• result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfLines(self, widths: List[int], s: str) -> List[int]:
        line, cur = 1, 0

        for i in s:
            width = widths[ord(i) - ord('a')]
            line += 1 if cur + width > 100 else 0
            cur = width if cur + width > 100 else cur + width
            
        return [line, cur]
