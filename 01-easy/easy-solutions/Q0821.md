## Q0821: Shortest Distance to a Character

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers answer where answer.length == s.length and answer[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.

The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute value function.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def shortestToChar(self, s: str, c: str) -> List[int]:
        c_idx = []

        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch == c:
                c_idx.append(i)

        right = 0
        left = -1
        ans = []

        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch == c:
                ans.append(0)
                right += 1
                left += 1
            elif i < c_idx[0]:
                ans.append(c_idx[right] - i)
            elif i > c_idx[-1]:
                ans.append(i - c_idx[left])
            else:
                ans.append(min(i - c_idx[left], c_idx[right] - i))

        return ans
