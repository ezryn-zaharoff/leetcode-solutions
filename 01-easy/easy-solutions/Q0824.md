## Q0824: [Goat Latin](https://leetcode.com/problems/goat-latin/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string sentence that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and
uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat
Latin are as follows:

• If a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append "ma" to the end of the word.
     For example, the word "apple" becomes "applema".
• If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then
  add "ma".
    • For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
• Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
    • For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end, and
      so on.

Return the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def toGoatLatin(self, sentence: str) -> str:
        words = sentence.split()
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            addition = 'ma' + ('a' * (i + 1))

            if word[0] in vowels:
                words[i] = word + addition
            else:
                words[i] = word[1:] + word[0] + addition
        
        return ' '.join(words)
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public String toGoatLatin(String sentence) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            String addition = "" + "ma" + "a".repeat(i+1);
            int n = words[i].length();

            if (vowels.indexOf(words[i].charAt(0)) != -1) {
                words[i] = words[i] + addition;
            } else {
                words[i] = words[i].substring(1, n) + words[i].charAt(0) + addition;
            }
        }

        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
