## Q0832: [Flipping an Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

• For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

• For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution(object):
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, image):
        ans = image
    
        for brac in ans:
            brac.reverse()
            for i in range(len(brac)):
                brac[i] = 1 if brac[i] == 0 else 0
        
        return ans

            ans[i].reverse()
            for j in 0..<ans[i].count {
                ans[i][j] = ans[i][j] == 0 ? 1 : 0
            }
        }
        
        return ans
    }
}
