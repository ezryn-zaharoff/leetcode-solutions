## Q0872: [Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value
sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        tree1 = []
        tree2 = []

        def dfs(node, arr):
            if not node: return

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                arr.append(node.val)

            dfs(node.left, arr)
            dfs(node.right, arr)

        dfs(root1, tree1)
        dfs(root2, tree2)
        
        return tree1 == tree2
