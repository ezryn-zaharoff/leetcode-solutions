Description:

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = []

        for ch in s:
            if ans and ch == ans[-1]:
                ans.pop()
            else:
                ans.append(ch)

        return ''.join(ans)
