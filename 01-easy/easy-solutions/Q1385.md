## Q1385: [Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-distance-value-between-two-arrays/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, return the distance value between the two arrays.

The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findTheDistanceValue(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        count = 0

        for i in range(len(arr1)):
            for j in range(len(arr2)):
                diff = abs(arr1[i] - arr2[j])
                if diff <= d: break
                if j == len(arr2)-1: count += 1

        return count
```
