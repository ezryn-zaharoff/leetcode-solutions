## Q1455: [Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord
is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord
is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word
return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:
        words = sentence.split()

        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if word.startswith(searchWord):
                return i+1

        return -1
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int isPrefixOfWord(String sentence, String searchWord) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        int count = 0;

        for (String word : words) {
            count++;
            if (word.startsWith(searchWord)) return count;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
