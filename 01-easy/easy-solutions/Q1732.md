```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes.
The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​
and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def largestAltitude(self, gain: List[int]) -> int:
        curr, ans = 0, 0

        for num in gain:
            curr += num
            ans = max(ans, curr)

        return ans
