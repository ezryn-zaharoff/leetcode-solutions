Description:

You are given a string title consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:

• If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
• Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.

Return the capitalized title.

class Solution:
    def capitalizeTitle(self, title: str) -> str:
        words = title.lower().split()
        m = len(words)

        for i in range(m):
            word = words[i]

            if len(word) > 2:
                words[i] = word.title()
            else:
                continue

        return ' '.join(words)
