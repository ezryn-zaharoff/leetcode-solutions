## Q2164: [Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-even-and-odd-indices-independently/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:

1. Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
    • For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1
      and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
    
2. Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
    • For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0
      and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def sortEvenOdd(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums[::2] = sorted(nums[::2])
        nums[1::2] = sorted(nums[1::2], reverse = True)
        return nums
