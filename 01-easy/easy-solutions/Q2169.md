## Q2169: [Count Operations to Obtain Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-operations-to-obtain-zero/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.

In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

â€¢ For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4.
  However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def countOperations(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        count = 0

        while num1 > 0 and num2 > 0:
            if num1 >= num2: num1 -= num2
            else: num2 -= num1
            count += 1

        return count
