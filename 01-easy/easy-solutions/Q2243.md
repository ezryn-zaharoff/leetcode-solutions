## Q2243: [Calculate Digit Sum of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-digit-sum-of-a-string/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

1. Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k
   characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
2. Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, "346" is replaced
   with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
3. Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat
   from step 1.

Return s after all rounds have been completed.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def digitSum(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        while len(s) > k:
            sub = ''
            for i in range(0, len(s), k):
                sub += str(sum(int(d) for d in s[i:i+k]))
            s = sub

        return s
```

#### Java:

```
public class Solution {
    public String digitSum(String s, int k) {
        while (s.length() > k) {
            StringBuilder sub = new StringBuilder();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += k) {
                String group = s.substring(i, Math.min(i + k, s.length()));
                
                int sum = 0;
                for (char c : group.toCharArray()) {
                    sum += Character.getNumericValue(c);
                }
                
                sub.append(sum);
            }
            
            s = sub.toString();
        }
        
        return s;
    }
}
