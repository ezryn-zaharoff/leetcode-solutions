Description:

A password is said to be strong if it satisfies all the following criteria:

• It has at least 8 characters.
• It contains at least one lowercase letter.
• It contains at least one uppercase letter.
• It contains at least one digit.
• It contains at least one special character. The special characters are the characters in the following string: "!@#$%^&*()-+".
• It does not contain 2 of the same character in adjacent positions (i.e., "aab" violates this condition, but "aba" does not).

Given a string password, return true if it is a strong password. Otherwise, return false.

                any(c.islower() for c in password) and \
                any(c.isupper() for c in password) and \
                any(c in '!@#$%^&*()-+' for c in password) and \
                all(a != b for a, b in pairwise(password)) and \
