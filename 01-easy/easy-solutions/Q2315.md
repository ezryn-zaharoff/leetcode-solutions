```
Description:

You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair.
In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        subs = s.split("|")
        n, count = len(subs), 0

        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0 and "*" in subs[i]:
                count += subs[i].count('*')

        return count
