Description:

You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair.
In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.

Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        slist = list(s.split("|"))
        counter = 0

        for i in range(len(slist)):
            if (i % 2 == 0) and ("*" in slist[i]):
                counter += slist[i].count('*')

        return counter
