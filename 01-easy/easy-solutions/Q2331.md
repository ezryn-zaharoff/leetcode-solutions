## Q2331: [Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:

• Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
• Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.

The evaluation of a node is as follows:

• If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
• Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's
  evaluations.

Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.

A leaf node is a node that has zero children.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def evaluateTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return None

            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)

            if node.val == 2: return left or right
            if node.val == 3: return left and right

            return node.val

        return bool(dfs(root))
