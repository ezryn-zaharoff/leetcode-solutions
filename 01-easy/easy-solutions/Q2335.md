```
Description:

You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, or 1 cup of any type of water.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def fillCups(self, amount: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0

        while amount[0] > 0 or amount[1] > 0 or amount[2] > 0:
            amount.sort(reverse = True)
            count += 1
            amount[0] -= 1
            amount[1] -= 1

        return count
```
