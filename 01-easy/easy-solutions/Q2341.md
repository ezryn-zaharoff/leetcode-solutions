## Q2341: [Maximum Number of Pairs in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-pairs-in-array/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

â€¢ Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
â€¢ Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.

The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        num_count = Counter(nums)
        n, ans = len(nums), 0

        for num in num_count:
            ans += num_count[num] // 2

        return [ans, n - ans * 2]
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfPairs(int[] nums) {
        int num_count[] = new int[101];

        int total = 0, left = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            num_count[nums[i]]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < num_count.length; i++) {
            if (num_count[i] > 0){
                total += num_count[i] / 2;
                left += num_count[i] % 2;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{total, left};
    }
}
```
