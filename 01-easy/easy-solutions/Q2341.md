## Q2341: Maximum Number of Pairs in Array

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:

• Choose two integers in nums that are equal.
• Remove both integers from nums, forming a pair.

The operation is done on nums as many times as possible.

Return a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        num_count = Counter(nums)
        total = 0
        left = 0

        for num, count in num_count.items():
            if count % 2 == 0:
                total += count // 2
            else:
                total += count // 2
                left += 1
            
        return [total, left]
```
