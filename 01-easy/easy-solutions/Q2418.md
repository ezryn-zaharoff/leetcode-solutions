## Q2418: [Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def sortPeople(self, names: List[str], heights: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        n = len(heights)
        hashmap = {}

        for i in range(n):
            hashmap[heights[i]] = names[i]

        heights.sort(reverse = True)

        return [hashmap[height] for height in heights] 
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        HashMap<Integer,String> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            hashmap.put(heights[i], names[i]);
        }

        Arrays.sort(heights);

        String[] ans = new String[n];
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans[n-1-i] = hashmap.get(heights[i]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
