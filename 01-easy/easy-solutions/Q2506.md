## Q2506: [Count Pairs Of Similar Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-similar-strings/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed string array words.

Two strings are similar if they consist of the same characters.

• For example, "abca" and "cba" are similar since both consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
• However, "abacba" and "bcfd" are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return the number of pairs (i, j) such that 0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1 and the two strings words[i] and words[j] are similar.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def similarPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        n, count = len(words), 0

        for i in range(n-1):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if set(words[i]) == set(words[j]):
                    count += 1

        return count
