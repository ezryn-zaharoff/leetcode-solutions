## Q2506: [Count Pairs Of Similar Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-pairs-of-similar-strings/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed string array words.

Two strings are similar if they consist of the same characters.

• For example, "abca" and "cba" are similar since both consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
• However, "abacba" and "bcfd" are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return the number of pairs (i, j) such that 0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1 and the two strings words[i] and
words[j] are similar.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def similarPairs(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        mp = {}
        count = 0

        for word in words:
            currSet = frozenset(word)

            if currSet in mp:
                count += mp[currSet]
                mp[currSet] += 1
            else:
                mp[currSet] = 1
                
        return count
