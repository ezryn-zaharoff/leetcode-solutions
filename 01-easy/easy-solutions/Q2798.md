#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        count = 0

        for num in hours:
            if num >= target:
                count += 1

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : hours){
            if (num >= target) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

    let count = 0;

    for (let num of hours){
        if (num >= target) count++;

    return count;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : hours){
            if (num >= target) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Scala:

```
object Solution {
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: Array[Int], target: Int): Int = {
        var count = 0

        for (num <- hours){
            if (num >= target) count += 1
        }
