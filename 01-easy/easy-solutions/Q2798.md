Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

There are n employees in a company, numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee i has worked for hours[i] hours in
the company.

The company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.

You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers hours of length n and a non-negative integer target.

Return the integer denoting the number of employees who worked at least target hours.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        count = 0

        for num in hours:
            if num >= target:
                count += 1

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : hours){
            if (num >= target) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget = function(hours, target) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of hours){
        if (num >= target) count++;
    }

    return count;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : hours){
            if (num >= target) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Scala:

```
object Solution {
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: Array[Int], target: Int): Int = {
        var count = 0

        for (num <- hours) {
            if (num >= target) count += 1
        }

        count
    }
}
```

#### Go:

```
func numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours []int, target int) int {
    count := 0

    for _, num := range hours {
        if num >= target {count++}
    }

    return count
}
```

#### C#:

```
public class Solution {
    public int NumberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {
        int count = 0;

        foreach (int num in hours){
            if (num >= target) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### Swift:

```
class Solution {
    func numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(_ hours: [Int], _ target: Int) -> Int {
        var count = 0

        for num in hours {
            if num >= target {count += 1}
        }

        return count
    }
}
```

#### TypeScript:

```
function numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: number[], target: number): number {
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of hours){
        if (num >= target) count++;
    }

    return count;
};
