## Q2810: [Faulty Keyboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/faulty-keyboard/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Your laptop keyboard is faulty, and whenever you type a character 'i' on it, it reverses the string that you have written. Typing other characters works as expected.

You are given a 0-indexed string s, and you type each character of s using your faulty keyboard.

Return the final string that will be present on your laptop screen.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def finalString(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = ""

        for ch in s:
            if ch == 'i':
                ans = ans[::-1]
            else:
                ans = ans + ch

        return ans
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public String finalString(String s) {
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'i') ans = ans.reverse();
            else ans.append(ch);
        }

        return ans.toString();
    }
}
```
