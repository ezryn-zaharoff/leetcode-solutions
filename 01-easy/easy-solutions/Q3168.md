## Q3168: Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given a string s. Simulate events at each second i:

• If s[i] == 'E', a person enters the waiting room and takes one of the chairs in it.
• If s[i] == 'L', a person leaves the waiting room, freeing up a chair.

Return the minimum number of chairs needed so that a chair is available for every person
who enters the waiting room given that it is initially empty.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def minimumChairs(self, s: str) -> int:
        count, mx = 0, 0

        for ch in s:
            count += 1 if ch == 'E' else -1
            mx = max(mx,count)

        return mx
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int minimumChairs(String s) {
        int count = 0, mx = 0;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'E') count++;
            else count--;
            mx = Math.max(mx, count);
        }

        return mx;
    }
}
