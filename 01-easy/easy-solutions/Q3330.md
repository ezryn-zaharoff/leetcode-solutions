## Q3330: [Find the Original Typed String I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def possibleStringCount(self, word: str) -> int:
        count = 1

        for i in range(1, len(word)):
            if word[i] == word[i-1]: count += 1

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int possibleStringCount(String word) {
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(i-1)) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var possibleStringCount = function(word) {
    let count = 1;

        for (let i = 1; i < word.length; i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) == word.charAt(i-1)) count++;
        }

        return count;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); i++) {
            if (word[i] == word[i-1]) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
