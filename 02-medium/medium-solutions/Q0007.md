## Q0007: [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside
the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
        x *= sign
        rev = 0

        while x:
            rev = rev * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10
        
        return 0 if rev < -2**31 or rev > 2**31 - 1 else sign * rev
```
