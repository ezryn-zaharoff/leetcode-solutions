## Q0008: String to Integer (atoi)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").

2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.

3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.

4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.

class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s):
        num = '0123456789'
        res = ''
        for x in s:
            if x == ' ' and len(res) == 0:
                continue
            if x != ' ' and (x in '-+' or x in num) and len(res) == 0:
                res += x
            elif x in num:
                res += x
            else:
                break
        if res == '' or res in '-+':
            return 0
        else:
            if int(res) < -(2**31):
                return -(2**31)
            elif int(res) > (2**31 - 1):
                return (2**31 - 1)
            else:
                return int(res)
