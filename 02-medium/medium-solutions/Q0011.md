## Q0011: [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an integer array height of length n.
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        left, right = 0, n-1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            max_area = max(max_area, (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]))

            if height[left] < height[right]: left += 1
            else: right -= 1
        
        return max_area
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int left = 0, right = n-1;
        int max_area = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            max_area = Math.max(max_area, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
            
            if (height[left] < height[right]) left++;
            else right--;
        }

        return max_area;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let n = height.length;
    let left = 0, right = n-1;
    let max_area = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        max_area = Math.max(max_area, (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]));
            
        if (height[left] < height[right]) left++;
        else right--;
    }

    return max_area;
};
