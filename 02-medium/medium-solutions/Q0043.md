## Q0043: Multiply Strings

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        s = [0] * (len(num1) + len(num2))

        for i in reversed(range(len(num1))):
            for j in reversed(range(len(num2))):
                mult = int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
                summ = mult + s[i + j + 1]
                s[i + j] += summ // 10
                s[i + j + 1] = summ % 10

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c != 0:
                break

        return ''.join(map(str, s[i:])) 
```
