## Q0075: [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects
of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n-1):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
