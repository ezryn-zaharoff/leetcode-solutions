## Q0086: [Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes
greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        leftHead, rightHead = ListNode(), ListNode()
        left, right = leftHead, rightHead

        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                left.next = head
                left = left.next
            else:
                right.next = head
                right = right.next

            head = head.next

        left.next = rightHead.next
        right.next = None

        return leftHead.next
