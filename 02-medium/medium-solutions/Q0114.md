## Q0114: [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

• The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in
  the list and the left child pointer is always null.
• The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        if not root: return

        curr = root

        while curr:
            if curr.left:
                last = curr.left

                while last.right: last = last.right

                last.right = curr.right
                curr.right = curr.left
                curr.left = None

            curr = curr.right
