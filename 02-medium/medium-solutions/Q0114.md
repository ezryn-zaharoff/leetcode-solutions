## Q0114: [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

• The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in
  the list and the left child pointer is always null.
• The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        if not root: return

        curr = root

        while curr:
            if curr.left:
                last = curr.left

                while last.right: last = last.right

                last.right = curr.right
                curr.right = curr.left
                curr.left = None

            curr = curr.right
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;

        TreeNode curr = root;

        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode last = curr.left;

                while (last.right != null) last = last.right;

                last.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }

            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var flatten = function(root) {
    if (!root) return;

    var curr = root;

    while (curr) {
        if (curr.left) {
            var last = curr.left;

            while (last.right) last = last.right;

            last.right = curr.right;
            curr.right = curr.left;
            curr.left = null;
        }

        curr = curr.right;
    }
};
