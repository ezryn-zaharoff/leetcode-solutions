## Q0116: [Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.
The binary tree has the following definition:

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer
should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root: return None

        curr = root

        while curr.left:
            last = curr

            while last:
                last.left.next = last.right

                if last.next:
                    last.right.next = last.next.left

                last = last.next

            curr = curr.left

        return root
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;

        Node curr = root;

        while (curr.left != null) {
            Node last = curr;

            while (last != null) {
                last.left.next = last.right;

                if (last.next != null) {
                    last.right.next = last.next.left;
                }

                last = last.next;
            }

            curr = curr.left;
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var connect = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;

    var curr = root;

    while (curr.left) {
        var last = curr;

        while (last) {
            last.left.next = last.right;

            if (last.next) {
                last.right.next = last.next.left;
            }

            last = last.next;
        }

        curr = curr.left;
    }

    return root;
};
