## Q0117: [Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer
should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if root is None: return None

        curr = root

        while curr:
            temp = Node()
            current = temp

            while curr:
                if curr.left:
                    current.next = curr.left
                    current = current.next

                if curr.right:
                    current.next = curr.right
                    current = current.next
                    
                curr = curr.next

            curr = temp.next

        return root
