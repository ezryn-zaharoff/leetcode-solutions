class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0

        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]

        return profit
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;

            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }

        return profit;
    }
}
```

var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let profit = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
    }

    return profit;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
