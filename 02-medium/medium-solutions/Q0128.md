## Q0128: [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        max_count, count, prev = 0, 1, float('-inf')

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == prev + 1:
                count += 1
                prev = nums[i]
            elif nums[i] != prev:
                count = 1
                prev = nums[i]

            max_count = max(max_count, count)

        return max_count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        
        nums.sort()
        n, prev = len(nums), float('-inf')
        count, max_count = 1, 0

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == prev + 1:
                count += 1
                prev = nums[i]
            elif nums[i] != prev:
                count = 1
                prev = nums[i]

            max_count = max(max_count, count)

        return max_count
