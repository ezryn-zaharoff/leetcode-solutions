## Q0128: [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return 0
        
        nums_sorted = sorted(list(set(nums)))
        n = len(nums_sorted)
        max_count, count = 0, 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums_sorted[i] == nums_sorted[i-1] + 1:
                count += 1
            else:
                max_count = max(max_count, count)
                count = 1

        return max(max_count, count)
