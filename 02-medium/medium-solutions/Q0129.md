## Q0129: [Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

â€¢ For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.

Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a
32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        ans = 0

        def dfs(root, ans):
            if not root: return 0

            ans = ans*10 + root.val

            if not root.left and not root.right:
                return ans

            return dfs(root.left, ans) + dfs(root.right, ans)

        return dfs(root, ans)
