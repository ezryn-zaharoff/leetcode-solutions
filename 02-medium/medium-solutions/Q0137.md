## Q0137: Single Number II

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for x in nums:       # For loop
            count[x] += 1    # {2 : 3, 3 : 1}

        for x, freq in count.items():    # For loop
            if freq == 1:
                return x
        
        return -1
```
