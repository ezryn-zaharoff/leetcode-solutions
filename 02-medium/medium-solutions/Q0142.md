## Q0142: [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer
is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast: break
        else: return None

        fast = head

        while fast != slow:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        return slow
