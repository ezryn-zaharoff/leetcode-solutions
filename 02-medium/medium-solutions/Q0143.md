## Q0143: [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next: return

        # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            next_temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_temp

        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        first, second = head, prev
        while second.next:
            # Store next nodes
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            
            # Reorder nodes
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            
            # Move to the next pair of nodes
            first = temp1
            second = temp2
