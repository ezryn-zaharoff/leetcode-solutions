## Q0151: Reverse Words In A String

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        words.reverse()
        return ' '.join(words)
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        String ans = "";

        for (int i = words.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans += words[i];

            if (i == 0) {
                break;
            } else {
                ans += " ";
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
