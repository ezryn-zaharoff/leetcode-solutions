## Q0167: [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such
that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where
1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of
length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(numbers)
        left, right = 0, n-1

        while left < right:
            total = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

            if total == target:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
            elif total < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
