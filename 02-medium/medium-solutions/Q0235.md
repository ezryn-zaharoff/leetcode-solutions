## Q0235: [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q
as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of
itself).”
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        curr = root

        while curr:
            if curr.val < p.val and curr.val < q.val:
                curr = curr.right
            elif curr.val > p.val and curr.val > q.val:
                curr = curr.left
            else:    
                return curr
