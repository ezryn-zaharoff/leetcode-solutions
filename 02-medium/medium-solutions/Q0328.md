## Q0328: [Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes
with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next: return head

        odd = head
        even = head.next
        evenHead = even

        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = even.next
            odd = odd.next
            even.next = odd.next
            even = even.next

        odd.next = evenHead

        return head
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode odd = head;
        ListNode even = head.next;
        ListNode evenHead = even;

        while (even != null && even.next != null) {
            odd.next = even.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even.next = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
        }

        odd.next = evenHead;

        return head;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var oddEvenList = function(head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

    var odd = head;
    var even = head.next;
    var evenHead = even;

    while (even != null && even.next != null) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }

    odd.next = evenHead;

    return head;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return head;

        ListNode* odd = head;
        ListNode* even = head->next;
        ListNode* evenHead = even;

        while (even && even->next) {
            odd->next = even->next;
            odd = odd->next;
            even->next = odd->next;
            even = even->next;
        }

        odd->next = evenHead;

        return head;
    }
};
