## Q0445: [Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes
first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        s1, s2 = "", ""

        while l1:
            s1 += str(l1.val)
            l1 = l1.next

        while l2:
            s2 += str(l2.val)
            l2 = l2.next

        s = str(int(s1) + int(s2))
        
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy

        for i in s:
            curr.next = ListNode(int(i))
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
