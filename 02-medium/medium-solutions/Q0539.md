## Q0539: [Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any
two time-points in the list.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:

        def time_to_mins(t):
            h, m = t.split(":")
            mins = int(h) * 60 + int(m)
            return mins

        timePoints = [time_to_mins(t) for t in timePoints]
        timePoints.sort()

        min_diff, n = (24 * 60), len(timePoints)

        for i in range(n-1):

            t1 = timePoints[i]
            t2 = timePoints[i+1]
            if t1 == t2: return 0
            min_diff = min(t2 - t1, min_diff)

        min_diff = min(min_diff, (24 * 60) + timePoints[0] - timePoints[-1])

        return min_diff
