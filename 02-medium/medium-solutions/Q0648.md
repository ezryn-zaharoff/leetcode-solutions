## Q0648: [Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer
word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful",
we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces,
replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by
more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        words = sentence.split()

        for i in range(len(words)):
            for sub in dictionary:
                if words[i].startswith(sub):
                    words[i] = sub

        return ' '.join(words)
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public String replaceWords(List<String> dictionary, String sentence) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            for (String sub : dictionary) {
                if (words[i].startsWith(sub)) {
                    words[i] = sub;
                }
            }
        }

        String ans = String.join(" ", words);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var replaceWords = function(dictionary, sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(" ")

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (let sub of dictionary) {
            if (words[i].startsWith(sub)) {
                words[i] = sub
            }
        }
    }

    return words.join(' ')
};
```

#### C++:

```

```

#### Scala:

```
object Solution {
    def replaceWords(dictionary: List[String], sentence: String): String = {
        var words = sentence.split(" ")

        for (i <- 0 until words.length) {
            for (sub <- dictionary) {
                if (words(i).startsWith(sub)) {
                    words(i) = sub
                }
            }
        }

        return words.mkString(" ")
    }
}
```

#### Go:

```
func replaceWords(dictionary []string, sentence string) string {
    words := strings.Split(sentence, " ")

    for i := 0; i < len(words); i++ {
        for _, sub := range dictionary {
            if strings.HasPrefix(words[i], sub) {
                words[i] = sub
            }
        }
    }

    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}
```
