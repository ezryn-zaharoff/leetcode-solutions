## Q0669: [Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so
that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the
elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven
that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def trimBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], low: int, high: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root: return root

        if root.val < low: return self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)
        if root.val > high: return self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)

        root.left = self.trimBST(root.left, low, high)
        root.right = self.trimBST(root.right, low, high)

        return root
