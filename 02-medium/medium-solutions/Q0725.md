## Q0725: [Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list
parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than
one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have
a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return an array of the k parts.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def splitListToParts(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> List[Optional[ListNode]]:
        # Pre-fill the result array with 'None'
        ans = [None] * k
        if not head: return ans

        # Step 1: Calculate the size of the list
        n, curr = 0, head
        while curr:
            n += 1
            curr = curr.next

        # Step 2: Determine the base size and extra parts
        base = n // k
        extra = n % k

        # Step 3: Split the list
        curr = head
        for i in range(k):
            ans[i] = curr
            part = base + (1 if extra > i else 0)

            for j in range(part - 1):
                curr = curr.next

            if curr:
                nxt = curr.next
                curr.next = None
                curr = nxt

        return ans
