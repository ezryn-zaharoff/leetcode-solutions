## Q0811: Subdomain Visit Count

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

A website domain "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com" and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain like "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit the parent domains "leetcode.com" and "com" implicitly.

A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats "rep d1.d2.d3" or "rep d1.d2" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

â€¢ For example, "9001 discuss.leetcode.com" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def subdomainVisits(self, cpdomains: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        domain_count = defaultdict(int)
        
        for cpdomain in cpdomains:
            count, domain = cpdomain.split()
            count = int(count)
            
            subdomains = domain.split(".")
            
            for i in range(len(subdomains)):
                subdomain = ".".join(subdomains[i:])
                domain_count[subdomain] += count

        ans = [str(count) + " " + subdomain for subdomain, count in domain_count.items()]
        
        return ans
