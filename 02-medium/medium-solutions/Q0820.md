## Q0820: Short Encoding of Words

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:

• words.length == indices.length
• The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
• For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].

Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        arr = sorted([x[::-1] for x in words])
        count = 0

        for i in range(len(arr)-1):
            if len(arr[i+1]) < len(arr[i]) or arr[i+1][:len(arr[i])] != arr[i]:
                count += (len(arr[i]) + 1)

        count += (len(arr[-1]) + 1)

        return count 
```
