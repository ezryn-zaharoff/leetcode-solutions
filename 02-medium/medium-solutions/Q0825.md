Difficulty Level: MEDIUM

```
Description:

There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.

A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:

• age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
• age[y] > age[x]
• age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100

Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.

Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.

Return the total number of friend requests made.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages):
        def check(age_x, age_y):
            return (age_y <= 0.5 * age_x + 7) or (age_y > age_x) or (age_y > 100 and age_x < 100)

        age_count, total = Counter(ages), 0 

        for age1, count1 in age_count.items():
            for age2, count2 in age_count.items():
                if not check(age1, age2):
                    total += count1 * count2 
                    if age1 == age2:
                        total -= count1

        return total
```
