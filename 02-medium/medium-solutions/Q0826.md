## Q0826: Most Profit Assigning Work

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:

• difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
• worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

• For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int], worker: List[int]) -> int:
        worker.sort(reverse=True)

        jobs = [(profit[i], difficulty[i]) for i in range(len(profit))]
        jobs.sort(reverse=True)

        k, total = 0, 0
        for i, level in enumerate(worker):
            for i in range(k, len(jobs)):
                if level >= jobs[i][1]:
                    total += jobs[i][0]
                    break
                k += 1

        return total
```
