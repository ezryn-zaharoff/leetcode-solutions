## Q0880: Decoded String at Index

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

â€¢ If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
â€¢ f the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.

Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        m = len(s)
        sub = ""

        for i in range(m):
            if len(sub) >= k:
                break
            else:
                if s[i].isalpha():
                    sub = sub + s[i]
                else:
                    sub *= int(s[i])
        
        return sub[k-1]
