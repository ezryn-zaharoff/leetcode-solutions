## Q0881: [Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats
where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time,
provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(people) - 1
        boats = 0

        while left <= right:
            if people[left] + people[right] <= limit: left += 1
            right -= 1
            boats += 1
            
        return boats
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int left = 0, right = people.length - 1;
        int boats = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) left++;
            right--;
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var numRescueBoats = function(people, limit) {
    people.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});
    let left = 0, right = people.length - 1;
    let boats = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) left++;
        right--;
        boats++;
    }
        
    return boats;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int left = 0, right = people.size() - 1;
        int boats = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) left++;
            right--;
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
