## Q1038: [Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original
BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def bstToGst(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:

        def dfs(node, currsum):
            if not node: return currsum

            node.val += dfs(node.right, currsum)

            return dfs(node.left, node.val) 

        dfs(root, 0)
        return root
