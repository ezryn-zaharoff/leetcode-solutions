## Q1171: [Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there
are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        
        # Dictionary to store the prefix sum and corresponding node
        prefix_sum_map = {}
        cursum = 0
        curr = dummy
        
        # First pass: Build the prefix sum map
        while curr:
            cursum += curr.val
            prefix_sum_map[cursum] = curr
            curr = curr.next
        
        # Second pass: Reset connections to remove zero-sum subsequences
        cursum = 0
        curr = dummy
        while curr:
            cursum += curr.val
            # Skip to the last occurrence of the current prefix sum
            curr.next = prefix_sum_map[cursum].next
            curr = curr.next
        
        return dummy.next
