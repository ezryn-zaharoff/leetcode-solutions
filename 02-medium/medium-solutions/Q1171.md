## Q1171: [Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there
are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        
        # Dictionary to store the prefix sum and corresponding node
        mp = {}
        
        # First pass: Build the prefix sum map
        currsum = 0
        curr = dummy
        while curr:
            currsum += curr.val
            mp[currsum] = curr
            curr = curr.next
        
        # Second pass: Reset connections to remove zero-sum subsequences
        currsum = 0
        curr = dummy
        while curr:
            currsum += curr.val
            # Skip to the last occurrence of the current prefix sum
            curr.next = mp[currsum].next
            curr = curr.next
        
        return dummy.next
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        HashMap<Integer, ListNode> mp = new HashMap<>();

        int currsum = 0;
        ListNode curr = dummy;
        while (curr != null) {
            currsum += curr.val;
            mp.put(currsum, curr);
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        currsum = 0;
        curr = dummy;
        while (curr != null) {
            currsum += curr.val;
            curr.next = mp.get(currsum).next;
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
