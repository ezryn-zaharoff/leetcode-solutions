## Q1404: [Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1
under the following rules:

• If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
• If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        num = int(s, 2)
        count = 0

        while num > 1:
            if num % 2 == 0: num //= 2
            else: num += 1
            count += 1

        return count
