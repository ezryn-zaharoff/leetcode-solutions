## Q1530: [Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary
tree is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], distance: int) -> int:
        self.ans = 0
        self.distance = distance
        self.dfs(root)
        return self.ans

    def dfs(self, node):
        if not node: return []
        if not node.left and not node.right: return [0]

        left = self.dfs(node.left)
        right = self.dfs(node.right)

        for l in left:
            for r in right:
                if l + r + 2 <= self.distance:
                    self.ans += 1

        return [d + 1 for d in left + right if d + 1 <= self.distance]
