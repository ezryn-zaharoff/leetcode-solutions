## Q2130: [Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin
of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

â€¢ For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only
  nodes with twins for n = 4.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        stack = []
        slow = fast = head
            
        while fast and fast.next:
            stack.append(slow.val)
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        if fast: slow = slow.next

        max_twin = 0

        while slow:
            top = stack.pop()
            max_twin = max(max_twin, top + slow.val)
            slow = slow.next

        return max_twin
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            stack.push(slow.val);
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        if (fast != null) slow = slow.next;

        int max_twin = 0;

        while (slow != null) {
            int top = stack.pop();
            max_twin = Math.max(max_twin, top + slow.val);
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        return max_twin;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var pairSum = function(head) {
    let stack = [];
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        stack.push(slow.val);
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    if (fast) slow = slow.next;

    let max_twin = 0;

    while (slow) {
        let top = stack.pop();
        max_twin = Math.max(max_twin, top + slow.val);
        slow = slow.next;
    }

    return max_twin;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        stack<int> stack;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        while (fast && fast->next) {
            stack.push(slow->val);
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        if (fast) slow = slow->next;

        int max_twin = 0;

        while (slow) {
            int top = stack.top();
            max_twin = max(max_twin, top + slow->val);
            stack.pop();
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        return max_twin;
    }
};
