## Q2181: [Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning
and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the
sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def mergeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        curr = head

        while (curr and curr.next):
            if (curr.next.val != 0):
                curr.val += curr.next.val
                curr.next = curr.next.next
            else:
                curr.next = curr.next.next
                curr = curr.next

        return head 
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
        ListNode curr = head;

        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            if (curr.next.val != 0) {
                curr.val += curr.next.val;
                curr.next = curr.next.next;
            } else {
                curr.next = curr.next.next;
                curr = curr.next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var mergeNodes = function(head) {
    let curr = head;

    while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
        if (curr.next.val != 0) {
            curr.val += curr.next.val;
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
        } else {
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }

    return head;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* curr = head;

        while (curr != NULL && curr->next != NULL) {
            if (curr->next->val != 0) {
                curr->val += curr->next->val;
                curr->next = curr->next->next;
            } else {
                curr->next = curr->next->next;
                curr = curr->next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
};
