## Q2225: [Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri
defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

• answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
• answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.

The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

• You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
• The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def findWinners(self, matches: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        no_losses = set()
        one_loss = set()
        losers = set()

        for (winner, loser) in matches:
            if (winner not in losers and winner not in one_loss):
                no_losses.add(winner)

            if (loser in no_losses):
                no_losses.remove(loser)
                one_loss.add(loser)

            elif (loser in one_loss):
                one_loss.remove(loser)
                losers.add(loser)
            
            elif (loser not in losers):
                one_loss.add(loser)
        
        winners = sorted(list(no_losses))
        one_loss = sorted(list(one_loss))

        return [winners, one_loss]
