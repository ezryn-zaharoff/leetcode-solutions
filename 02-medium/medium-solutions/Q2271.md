## Q2271: Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given a 2D integer array tiles where tiles[i] = [li, ri] represents that every tile j in the range li <= j <= ri is colored white.

You are also given an integer carpetLen, the length of a single carpet that can be placed anywhere.

Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maximumWhiteTiles(self, tiles: List[List[int]], carpetLen: int) -> int:
        tiles.sort() 
        left, curtotal, ans = 0, 0, 0

        for tl, tr in tiles:
            curtotal += tr - tl + 1

            while carpetLen < tr - tiles[left][1] + 1:
                curtotal -= tiles[left][1] - tiles[left][0] + 1
                left += 1

            extra = tr - tiles[left][0] + 1 - carpetLen

            if extra > 0:
                ans = max(ans, curtotal - extra)
            else:
                ans = max(ans, curtotal)

        return ans
