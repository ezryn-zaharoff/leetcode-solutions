## Q2279: [Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-bags-with-full-capacity-of-rocks/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You have n bags numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays capacity and rocks.
The ith bag can hold a maximum of capacity[i] rocks and currently contains rocks[i] rocks. You are also given
an integer additionalRocks, the number of additional rocks you can place in any of the bags.

Return the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        diff = [capacity[i] - rocks[i] for i in range(len(rocks))]
        diff.sort()

        count = 0
        for num in diff:
            if additionalRocks >= num:
                count += 1
                additionalRocks -= num

        return count
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int maximumBags(int[] capacity, int[] rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        int n = capacity.length;
        int[] diff = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(diff);

        int count = 0;
        for (int num : diff) {
            if (additionalRocks >= num) {
                count++;
                additionalRocks -= num;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
ar maximumBags = function(capacity, rocks, additionalRocks) {
    let n = capacity.length;
    let diff = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        diff.push(capacity[i] - rocks[i]);
    }
    diff.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});

    let count = 0;
    for (let num of diff) {
        if (additionalRocks >= num) {
            count++;
            additionalRocks -= num;
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBags(vector<int>& capacity, vector<int>& rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        int n = capacity.size();
        vector<int> diff;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff.push_back(capacity[i] - rocks[i]);
        }
        sort(diff.begin(), diff.end());

        int count = 0;
        for (int num : diff) {
            if (additionalRocks >= num) {
                count++;
                additionalRocks -= num;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Scala:

```
object Solution {
    def maximumBags(capacity: Array[Int], rocks: Array[Int], additionalRocks: Int): Int = {
        var n = capacity.length
        var diff = new Array[Int](n)
        for (i <- 0 until n) {
            diff(i) = capacity(i) - rocks(i)
        }
        var d = diff.sorted

        var count = 0
        var additional = additionalRocks
        for (num <- d) {
            if (additional >= num) {
                count += 1
                additional -= num
            }
        }

        return count
    }
}
```

#### Go:

```

```

#### C#:

```
public class Solution {
    public int MaximumBags(int[] capacity, int[] rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        int n = capacity.Length;
        int[] diff = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
        }
        Array.Sort(diff);

        int count = 0;
        foreach (int num in diff) {
            if (additionalRocks >= num) {
                count++;

            }
        }

        return count;
    }

```

#### Swift:

```
class Solution {
    func maximumBags(_ capacity: [Int], _ rocks: [Int], _ additionalRocks: Int) -> Int {
        var n = capacity.count
        var diff = [Int]()
        for i in 0..<n {
            diff.append(capacity[i] - rocks[i])
        }
        diff.sort()

        var count = 0, additional = additionalRocks
        for num in diff {
            if additional >= num {
                count += 1
                additional -= num
