## Q2280: Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:

Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def minimumLines(self, stockPrices: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if len(stockPrices) == 1:
            return 0
        
        # Sorting the stock prices based on days
        stockPrices.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        
        # Initializing variables
        lines = 1  # We start with at least one line if there are at least two points
        n = len(stockPrices)
        
        # Iterating through the sorted stock prices
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            x1, y1 = stockPrices[i - 1]
            x2, y2 = stockPrices[i]
            x3, y3 = stockPrices[i + 1]
            
            # Calculating slopes
            slope1 = (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2)
            slope2 = (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)
            
            if slope1 != slope2:
                lines += 1
        
        return lines
