## Q2285: [Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional
road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The
importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maximumImportance(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        road_total = [0] * n
        
        for a, b in roads:
            road_total[a] += 1
            road_total[b] += 1

        ans, city = 0, 1
        for road_num in sorted(road_total):
            ans += road_num * city
            city += 1
            
        return ans
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        int[] degrees = new int[n];

        for (int[] road : roads) {
            degrees[road[0]]++;
            degrees[road[1]]++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(degrees);
        long ans = 0, city = 1;
        
        for (int d : degrees) {
            ans += d * city;
            city++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var maximumImportance = function(n, roads) {
    let road_total = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let road of roads) {
        road_total[road[0]]++;
        road_total[road[1]]++;
    }

    road_total.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let ans = 0;
        
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ans += road_total[i] * (i+1);
    }

    return ans;
};
