## Q2285: Maximum Total Importance of Roads

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def maximumImportance(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        road_total = [0] * n
        
        for a, b in roads:
            road_total[a] += 1
            road_total[b] += 1

        ans, city = 0, 1
        for road_num in sorted(road_total):
            ans += road_num * city
            city += 1
            
        return ans
```
