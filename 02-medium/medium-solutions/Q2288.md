## Q2288: Apply Discount to Prices

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word can contain digits, lowercase letters, and the dollar sign '$'. A word represents a price if it is a sequence of digits preceded by a dollar sign.

â€¢ For example, "$100", "$23", and "$6" represent prices while "100", "$", and "$1e5" do not.

You are given a string sentence representing a sentence and an integer discount. For each word representing a price, apply a discount of discount% on the price and update the word in the sentence. All updated prices should be represented with exactly two decimal places.

Return a string representing the modified sentence.

Note that all prices will contain at most 10 digits.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def discountPrices(self, sentence: str, discount: int) -> str:
        words = sentence.split()
        perc = (100 - discount) / 100

        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if word[0] == '$' and word[1:].isnumeric():
                price = float(word[1:])
                discounted_price = price * perc
                words[i] = f'${discounted_price:.2f}'

        return ' '.join(words)
