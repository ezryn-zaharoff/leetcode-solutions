## Q2300: Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def successfulPairs(self, spells: List[int], potions: List[int], success: int) -> List[int]:
        potions.sort(reverse=True)
        hashmap = {potion: i+1 for i, potion in enumerate(potions)}
        ans = []

        for spell in spells:
            val = math.ceil(success/spell)

            if val > potions[0]:
                ans.append(0)
            else:
                while val not in hashmap:
                    val += 1
                ans.append(hashmap[val])

        return ans
```
