## Q2611: [Mice and Cheese](https://leetcode.com/problems/mice-and-cheese/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

There are two mice and n different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index i (0-indexed) is:

• reward1[i] if the first mouse eats it.
• reward2[i] if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array reward1, a positive integer array reward2, and a non-negative integer k.

Return the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly k types of cheese.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def miceAndCheese(self, reward1: List[int], reward2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        total = sum(reward2)

        diffs = [reward1[i] - reward2[i] for i in range(len(reward1))]
        diffs.sort(reverse = True)

        for i in range(k):
            total += diffs[i]
        
        return total
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int miceAndCheese(int[] reward1, int[] reward2, int k) {
        int n = reward1.length;
        int total = 0;

        int[] diffs = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diffs[i] = reward1[i] - reward2[i];
            total += reward2[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(diffs);

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            total += diffs[n-1-i];
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```
