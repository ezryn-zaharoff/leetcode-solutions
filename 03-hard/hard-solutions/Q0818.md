## Q0818: Race Car

```
Difficulty Level: HARD
```

```
Description:

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):

• When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
    • position += speed
    • speed *= 2

• When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
    • If your speed is positive then speed = -1
    • otherwise speed = 1

    Your position stays the same.

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.

Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def racecar(self, target: int) -> int:
        q = deque()
        q.append((0, 1, 0))

        while q:
            pos, speed, n = q.popleft()

            if pos == target:
                return n

            q.append((pos + speed, speed * 2, n + 1))

            if speed > 0:
                if pos + speed > target:
                    q.append((pos, -1, n + 1))
            else:
                if pos + speed < target:
                    q.append((pos, 1, n + 1))
```
