## Q0827: Making A Large Island

```
Difficulty Level: HARD
```

```
Description:

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def largestIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)

        def find_val(ref, grid, r, c):
            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= n or c >= n or grid[r][c] == 0 or grid[r][c] == ref:
                return 0
            grid[r][c] = ref
            return 1 + (find_val(ref, grid, r+1, c) + find_val(ref, grid, r-1, c) + find_val(ref, grid, r, c+1) + find_val(ref, grid, r, c-1))

        ref, max_area = 2, -1
        island_size = {}

        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(n):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    island_sum = find_val(ref, grid, r, c)
                    island_size[ref] = island_sum
                    ref += 1
                    max_area = max(max_area, island_sum)

        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(n):
                if grid[r][c] == 0:
                    seen = set()
                    sum_area = 1
                    if r > 0:
                        seen.add(grid[r-1][c])
                    if c > 0:
                        seen.add(grid[r][c-1])
                    if r < n-1:
                        seen.add(grid[r+1][c])
                    if c < n-1:
                        seen.add(grid[r][c+1])
                    for island_ref in seen:
                        sum_area += island_size.get(island_ref, 0)
                    max_area = max(max_area, sum_area)

        return max_area
