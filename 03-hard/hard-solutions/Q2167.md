## Q2167: [Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-remove-all-cars-containing-illegal-goods/)

```
Difficulty Level: HARD
```

```
Description:

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents a sequence of train cars. s[i] = '0' denotes that
the ith car does not contain illegal goods and s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith car does contain illegal goods.

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of
the following three operations any number of times:

1. Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
2. Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
3. Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, s: str) -> int:
        count, m = 0, 0

        for num in s:
            count += 1 if num == '1' else -1
            if count < m: m = count
            if count > 0: count = 0

        return len(s) + m
```

#### Java:

```
class Solution {
    public int minimumTime(String s) {
        int count = 0, m = 0;

        for (char num : s.toCharArray()) {
            count += (num == '1') ? 1 : -1;
            if (count < m) m = count;
            if (count > 0) count = 0;
        }

        return s.length() + m;
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript:

```
var minimumTime = function(s) {
    let count = 0, m = 0;

    for (let num of s) {
        count += (num == '1') ? 1 : -1;
        if (count < m) m = count;
        if (count > 0) count = 0;
    }

    return s.length + m;
};
```

#### C++:

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTime(string s) {
        int count = 0, m = 0;

        for (char& num : s) {
            count += (num == '1') ? 1 : -1;
            if (count < m) m = count;
            if (count > 0) count = 0;
        }

        return s.size() + m;
    }
};
```

#### C#:

```
public class Solution {
    public int MinimumTime(string s) {
        int count = 0, m = 0;

        foreach (char num in s) {
            count += (num == '1') ? 1 : -1;
            if (count < m) m = count;
            if (count > 0) count = 0;
        }

        return s.Length + m;
    }
}
```

#### Swift:

```
class Solution {
    func minimumTime(_ s: String) -> Int {
        var count = 0, m = 0

        for num in s {
            if num == "1" { count += 1 }
            else { count -= 1 }
            if count < m { m = count }
            if count > 0 { count = 0 }
        }

        return s.count + m
    }
}
