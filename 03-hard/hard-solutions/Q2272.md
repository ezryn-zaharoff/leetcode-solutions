## Q2272: Substring With Largest Variance

```
Difficulty Level: HARD
```

```
Description:

The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
```

#### Python3:

```
class Solution:
    def largestVariance(self, s: str) -> int:
        m = len(s)
        max_var = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for k in range(1, m+1):
                sub = s[i:i+k]
                sub_count = Counter(sub)
                max_count = sub_count.most_common()[0][1] if sub_count else None
                min_count = sub_count.most_common()[-1][1] if sub_count else None
                max_var = max(max_var, max_count - min_count)

        return max_var
```
