```
Difficulty Level: EASY
```

```
Description:

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table.
If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server:

```
select firstname,
       lastname,
       city,
       state
from   person
       left join address
       on person.personid = address.personid
```

#### Pandas:

```
import pandas as pd

def combine_two_tables(person: pd.DataFrame, address: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = pd.merge(left = person, right = address, how = 'left', on = 'personId')[['firstName', 'lastName', 'city', 'state']]
    return df
```
