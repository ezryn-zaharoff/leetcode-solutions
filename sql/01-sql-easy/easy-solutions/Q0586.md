Description:

Table: Orders

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write a solution to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
with cte as (
    select   count(*) as max_count
    from     orders
    group by customer_number
    order by max_count desc
    limit    1
)

select distinct customer_number
from     orders,
         cte
group by customer_number, max_count
having   count(order_number) = max_count
```

#### Oracle:

```
with ranks as (
    select   customer_number
    from     orders
    group by customer_number
    order by count(order_number) desc
)

select *
from   ranks
where  rownum = 1
