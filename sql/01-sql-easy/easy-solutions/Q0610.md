Description:

Table: Triangle

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
 

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
select *,
       case
           when x + y > z and y + z > x and x + z > y then 'Yes'
           else 'No'
       end as triangle
from   triangle
```

#### Oracle:

```
select x, y, z,
       case
           when x + y > z and y + z > x and x + z > y then 'Yes'
           else 'No'
       end as triangle
from   triangle
