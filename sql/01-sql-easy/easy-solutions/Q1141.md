Description:

Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
 

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
select   activity_date as day,
         count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from     activity
where    activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'
group by 1
```

#### Oracle:

```
select   to_char(activity_date, 'yyyy-mm-dd') as day,
         count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from     activity
where    activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'
group by activity_date
```
