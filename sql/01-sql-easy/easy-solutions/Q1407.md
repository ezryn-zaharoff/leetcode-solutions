| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".
 

Write a solution to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
select   name,
         sum(coalesce(distance, 0)) as travelled_distance
from     users
         left join rides
         on users.id = rides.user_id
group by users.id, name
order by travelled_distance desc,
         name
```
