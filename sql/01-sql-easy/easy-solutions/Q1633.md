Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
 

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
with total as (
    select count(distinct user_id) as total_users
    from   users
)

select   contest_id,
         round(count(distinct user_id) * 100.0 / total_users, 2) as percentage
from     register, total
group by contest_id, total_users
order by percentage desc, contest_id
