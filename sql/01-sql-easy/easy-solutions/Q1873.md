Description:

Table: Employees

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
select   employee_id,
         case
             when employee_id % 2 != 0 and name not like 'M%' then salary
             else 0
         end as bonus
from     employees
order by employee_id
```

#### Oracle:

```
select   employee_id,
         case
             when mod(employee_id, 2) != 0 and name not like 'M%' then salary
             else 0
         end as bonus
from     employees
order by employee_id
```
