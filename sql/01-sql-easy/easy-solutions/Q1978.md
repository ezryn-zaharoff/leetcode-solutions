## Q1978: [Employees Whose Manager Left the Company](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-whose-manager-left-the-company/)

Description:

Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
select   employees.employee_id
from     employees
         left join employees managers
         on employees.manager_id = managers.employee_id
where    employees.salary < 30000
         and employees.manager_id is not null
         and managers.employee_id is null
order by employees.employee_id
```
