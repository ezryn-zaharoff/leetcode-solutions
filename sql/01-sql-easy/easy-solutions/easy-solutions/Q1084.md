product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
 

Write a solution to report the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
with cte as (
    select   product_id,
             count(sale_date) filter (where sale_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-03-31') as first_quarter_sales,
             count(sale_date) as all_sales
    from     sales
    group by product_id
)

select cte.product_id, product_name
from   cte
       left join product
       on cte.product_id = product.product_id
where  first_quarter_sales = all_sales
