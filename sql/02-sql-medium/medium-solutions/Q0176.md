Description:

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

```

with cte as (
    select salary,
           dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as ranking
    from   employee
)

select max(case when ranking = 2 then salary end) as SecondHighestSalary
from   cte
