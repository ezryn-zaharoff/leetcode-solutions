Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, return null.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS TABLE (Salary INT) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY (
    with cte as (
        select employee.salary,
               dense_rank() over (order by employee.salary desc) as ranking
        from employee
    )

    select distinct cte.salary
    from   cte
    where  ranking = N
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### MySQL:

```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      select distinct salary
      from Employee
      order by salary desc
      limit 1 offset N
  );
END
```

#### Oracle:

```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    select salary into result
    from (
        select salary, dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as ranking
        from employee
    )
    where ranking = N and rownum = 1;

    RETURN result;
END;
```
