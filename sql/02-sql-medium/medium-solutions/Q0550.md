Description:

Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on
someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first
logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in
for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total
number of players.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
with first_logins as (
    select   player_id,
             min(event_date) as first_login_date
    from     activity
    group by player_id
)

select round(count(activity.player_id)::numeric / (select count(distinct player_id) from first_logins), 2) as fraction
from   activity
       join first_logins
       on activity.player_id = first_logins.player_id
       and activity.event_date = first_login_date + interval '1 day'
```

#### MySQL:

```
with first_logins as (
    select   player_id,
             min(event_date) as first_login_date
    from     activity
    group by player_id
)

select round(count(activity.player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from first_logins), 2) as fraction
from   activity
       join first_logins
       on activity.player_id = first_logins.player_id
       and activity.event_date = date_add(first_login_date, interval 1 day)
```

#### Oracle:
