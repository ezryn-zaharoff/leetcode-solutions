+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |

(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

)

select   id,
         count(*) as num

    select   id,
             count(*) as num
    from     total
    group by id
    order by num desc
)

select *
