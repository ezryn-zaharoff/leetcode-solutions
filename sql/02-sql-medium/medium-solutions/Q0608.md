## Q0608: [Tree Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Table: Tree

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| p_id        | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.
 

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

• "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
• "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
• "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
select distinct tree.id,
       case
           when tree.p_id is null then 'Root'
           when child.id is null then 'Leaf'
           else 'Inner'
       end as type
from   tree
       left join tree child
       on tree.id = child.p_id
```
