## Q0626: [Exchange Seats](https://leetcode.com/problems/exchange-seats/)

```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
with cte as (
    select count(*) as total_students
    from   seat
)

select   case
             when total_students % 2 != 0 and id = total_students then id
             when id % 2 = 1 then id + 1
             when id % 2 = 0 then id - 1
         end as id,
         student
from     seat, cte
order by id
```

#### Oracle:

```
with cte as (
    select count(*) as total_students
    from   seat
)

select   case
             when mod(total_students, 2) != 0 and id = total_students then id
             when mod(id, 2) = 1 then id + 1
             when mod(id, 2) = 0 then id - 1
         end as id,
         student
from     seat, cte
order by id
```
