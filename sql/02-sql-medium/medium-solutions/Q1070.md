Write a solution to select the product id, year, quantity, and price for the first year of every product sold.

Return the resulting table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
with ranks as (
    select *,
           dense_rank() over (partition by product_id order by year) as ranking
    from   sales
)

select product_id,
       year as first_year,
       quantity,
       price
from   ranks
where  ranking = 1
```

#### Oracle:

```
with ranks as (
    select product_id,
           year,
           quantity,
           price,
           dense_rank() over (partition by product_id order by year) as ranking
    from   sales
)

select product_id,
       year as first_year,
       quantity,
       price
from   ranks
where  ranking = 1
