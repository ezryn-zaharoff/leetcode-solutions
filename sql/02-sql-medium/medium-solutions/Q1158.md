Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL:

```
select   user_id as buyer_id,
         join_date,
         count(item_id) as orders_in_2019
from     users
         left join orders
         on users.user_id = orders.buyer_id
         and order_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
group by user_id, join_date
order by user_id
```

#### Oracle:

```
select   user_id as buyer_id,
         to_char(join_date, 'RRRR-MM-DD') as join_date,
         count(item_id) as orders_in_2019
from     users
         left join orders
         on users.user_id = orders.buyer_id
         and order_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
group by user_id, join_date
order by user_id
