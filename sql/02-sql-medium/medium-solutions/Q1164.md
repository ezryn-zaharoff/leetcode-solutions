Description:

Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
with ids as (
    select distinct product_id
    from products
),

dates as (
    select   product_id,
             max(change_date) as max_date
    from     products
    where    change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    group by product_id
)

select ids.product_id,
       coalesce(products.new_price, 10) as price
from   ids
       left join dates
       on ids.product_id = dates.product_id
       left join products
       on ids.product_id = products.product_id
       and dates.max_date = products.change_date
```
