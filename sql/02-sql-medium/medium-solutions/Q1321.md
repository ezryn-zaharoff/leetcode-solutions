Description:

Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
with total_amount as (
    select   visited_on,
             sum(amount) as total
    from     customer
    group by visited_on
    order by visited_on
)

select visited_on,
       sum(total) over (rows between 6 preceding and current row) as amount,
       round(avg(total) over (rows between 6 preceding and current row), 2) as average_amount
from   total_amount
offset 6
```

#### MySQL:

```
with total_amount as (
    select   visited_on,
             sum(amount) as total
    from     customer
    group by visited_on
    order by visited_on
),

calculation as (
    select visited_on,
           sum(total) over (rows between 6 preceding and current row) as amount,
           round(avg(total) over (rows between 6 preceding and current row), 2) as average_amount
    from   total_amount
)

select *
from   calculation
where  visited_on >= (select date_add(min(visited_on), interval 6 day) from customer)
```

#### Oracle:

```
with total_amount as (
    select   visited_on,
             sum(amount) as total
    from     customer
    group by visited_on
    order by visited_on
),

calculation as (
    select to_char(visited_on, 'yyyy-mm-dd') as visited_on,
           sum(total) over (order by visited_on rows between 6 preceding and current row) as amount,
           round(avg(total) over (order by visited_on rows between 6 preceding and current row), 2) as average_amount
    from   total_amount
)

select *
from   calculation
where  visited_on >= (select min(visited_on) from customer) + interval '6' day
