```
Difficulty Level: MEDIUM
```

```
Description:

Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

• "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
• "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
• "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle:

```
select 'Low Salary' as category,
       count(distinct account_id) as accounts_count
from   accounts
where  income < 20000

union all

select 'Average Salary' as category,
       count(distinct account_id) as accounts_count
from   accounts
where  income >= 20000 and income <= 50000

union all

select 'High Salary' as category,
       count(distinct account_id) as accounts_count
from   accounts
where  income > 50000
