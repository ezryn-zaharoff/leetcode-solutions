Description:

Table: Trips

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | varchar  |     
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are foreign keys to the
users_id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM (category) type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').
 

Table: Users

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver',
'partner').
banned is an ENUM (category) type of ('Yes', 'No').
 

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned
users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be
banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
with cte as (
    select
        request_at,
        sum(case when users.banned = 'No' and drivers.banned = 'No' then 1 else 0 end) as total_trips,
        sum(case when status like 'cancelled_%' and users.banned = 'No' and drivers.banned = 'No' then 1 else 0 end) as total_cancelled_trips
    from
        trips
        left join users
        on trips.client_id = users.users_id
        left join users drivers
        on trips.driver_id = drivers.users_id
    where
        request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
    group by
        1
)

select
    request_at as "Day",
    round(total_cancelled_trips / total_trips::numeric, 2) as "Cancellation Rate"
from
    cte
where
    total_trips > 0
