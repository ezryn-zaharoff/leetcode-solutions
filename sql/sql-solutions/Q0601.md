Description:

Table: Stadium

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
As the id increases, the date increases as well.
 

Write a solution to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

```
with cte as (
    select
        *,
        id - row_number() over () as id_diff
    from
        stadium
    where
        people >= 100
),

cte2 as (
    select
        id_diff
    from
        cte
    group by id_diff
    having count(id_diff) > 2
)

select
    id,
    visit_date,
    people
from
    cte
    left join cte2
    on cte.id_diff = cte2.id_diff
where cte.id_diff = cte2.id_diff
order by 2
