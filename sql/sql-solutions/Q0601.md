Description:

Table: Stadium

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
As the id increases, the date increases as well.
 

Write a solution to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
```

#### PostgreSQL:

```
with cte as (
    select
        *,
        bool_and(people>=100) over (order by id rows between 2 preceding and current row) as c1
    from
        stadium
),

cte2 as (
    select
        *,
        bool_or(c1) over (order by id rows between current row and 2 following) as c2
    from
        cte
)

select
    id,
    visit_date,
    people
from
    cte2
where
    c2 is true
